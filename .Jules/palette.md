**Learning:** Users lack confidence when clicking destructive actions (like delete) without immediate visual feedback. Adding a specific loading state for the item being deleted prevents "rage clicking" and assures the user the system is working.
**Action:** Always verify delete actions have a loading state, especially in lists/tables where multiple items exist.
